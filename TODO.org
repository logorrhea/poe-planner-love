** Multiple Builds
*** DONE Allow for multiple builds
CLOSED: [2016-10-18 Tue 09:29]
*** DONE Allow quick-swapping between builds

*** DONE Allow naming of builds
CLOSED: [2016-10-22 Sat 09:07]
*** DONE Enable switching between build info and stat info
    CLOSED: [2016-10-18 Tue 20:00]
*** DONE Allow for deletion of builds

** Ascendancy Support
*** DONE Support ascendancy classes
CLOSED: [2016-10-18 Tue 09:48]
*** DONE Fix issue with ascendant "Path of XYZ" skill paths
    CLOSED: [2017-09-15 Fri 10:05]

Seems to work fine when activating the nodes initially. It might be part
of the serialization/de-serialization process to where the information is
not being saved correctly? Should check the encoded string we generate against
the official skill tree.
** Misc Fixes
*** DONE Some character stats still not being recorded correctly
    CLOSED: [2017-09-15 Fri 10:05]
*** TODO Better organize character stats?
*** TODO Improve display of number of regular and ascendancy points allocated

This should not be prohibitive (don't lock the user at the max active). However,
once the user has reached the maximum allowed points, the text should change
color or somehow otherwise indicate the user has allocated too many points.

*** DONE Use suit.Input for search box
CLOSED: [2016-10-18 Tue 12:31]
*** DONE Make search text input toggleable
CLOSED: [2016-10-26 Wed 11:26]
Start with like a search icon or something. Once clicked, start drawing suit.Input.
** Mobile-related Issues
*** DONE Disable touch-drag camera panning while changing classes
CLOSED: [2016-10-26 Wed 11:34]
*** DONE Fix zoom min/max on mobile
CLOSED: [2016-10-22 Sat 09:06]
*** TODO Make high-dpi versions of icons instead of scaling them
*** TODO Can't press "stats" or "builds" labels on mobile 
seems to work fine on the emulator, but pressing them on the phone is nigh on impossible
*** TODO Ditto for the new build button
** Bugz
*** TODO Can pan camera out way past skill tree
*** TODO Definitely bugs with initializing the save file
*** DONE Slight visual bugs with the sprites
    CLOSED: [2017-09-15 Fri 10:05]
    - Maybe we can simply change the filter mode?
    - Might also try scaling the inner node icons down just a tad to make sure they
    are properly hidden behind the frame.
** Changes
*** TODO Change input boxes back to custom implementation
    Consider moving all UI back to custom, but definitely at least the input boxes. They
    are glitchy on mobile and don't have some of the functionality I'd like.
*** TODO Change everything about the "Add Build (plus icon)" button.
    It is poop.
*** TODO Edit button should change to save icon when editing.
