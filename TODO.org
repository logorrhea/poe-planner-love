** Ascendancy Support
*** DONE Support ascendancy classes

*** TODO Fix issue with ascendant "Path of XYZ" skill paths

Seems to work fine when activating the nodes initially. It might be part
of the serialization/de-serialization process to where the information is
not being saved correctly? Should check the encoded string we generate against
the official skill tree.
** Misc Fixes
*** TODO Some character stats still not being recorded correctly
*** TODO Better organize character stats?
*** TODO Display number of regular and ascendancy points allocated

This should not be prohibitive (don't lock the user at the max active). However,
once the user has reached the maximum allowed points, the text should change
color or somehow otherwise indicate the user has allocated too many points.

CLOSED: [2016-10-18 Tue 12:31]

Start with like a search icon or something. Once clicked, start drawing suit.Input.
** Mobile-related Issues

*** DONE Fix zoom min/max on mobile
